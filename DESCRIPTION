Description: This package is based on the qBase algorithms published by 
 Hellemans et al. in 2007. The EasyqpcR package allows you to import easily qPCR
 data files as described in the vignette. Thereafter, you can calculate 
 amplification efficiencies, relative quantities and their standard errors, 
 normalization factors based on the best reference genes choosen (using the 
 SLqPCR package), and then the normalized relative quantities, the NRQs scaled 
 to your control and their standard errors. It proposes also a function 
 to aggregate the qPCR biological replicates followed by the realization 
 of the algorithm published by Willems et al. (2008) which is a standardization 
 procedure that  can be applied to data sets that display high variation between 
 biological replicates. This enables proper statistical  analysis and drawing 
 relevant conclusions. This package has been created for low-throughput qPCR 
 data analysis.
